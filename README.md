# Legend-Show
A tool whose purpose is to display information in organized-fashion about almost every player in Apex Legends.

I built this project in the time I was messing around and learning to work with API's. So it is not finished at all and lacks functionality (Not very interesting) but you can have fun looking and using it. And also, It's been a long time since I finished with this project (like 2yrs ago) and was considering whether to upload it at all.

# How To Use

This is the home screen.

A request is sent to the API and you get your information.

You can also register your player so you can go back to it while searching for other players.
